Repository List File ~/.mr4b_repos

    The list of registered repository folders is maintained in a hidden file
    in the user home directory. Individual lines in this file can be commented
    out by adding a "#" at the beginning of the line. Empty lines in this file
    are ignored. 
    
    The file will be created upon the first (successful) registration operation.
    
    The commands "register" and "registerRecursively" ensure that no folder
    is listed more than just once in this file.
    
    You can specify a custom Repository List File with option --file 
    (short form: -f).
    Example: mr4b --file /path/to/custom/GitRepoFile status
    If --file/-f is used, then it must appear before the command.
